# Desk Assist
## A device for automated desk environment comfort and control.
### Overview

This project was is a culmination of my desire to explore embedded system design and electrical components that I found in my house over winter break. The device, equiped with a fan, vent system, and lamp bulb was built with automated comfort in mind. Utilizing a temperature sensor and photoresistor, the device will turn the fan and vent on if the room is a certain temperature and will turn the lamp on if the room is dark. The device also is built with an OLED user interface where a user can customize fan speed, vent angle, and lamp brightness. The user can also toggle auto functionality for a given sensor on or off for a more customizable experience.

### Functionality
This project was built by using espidf to program an ESP32 DevKit C. FreeRTOS was used to create an embedded system that could effectively interact with the user and the environment in real time.
